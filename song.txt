I've been up, I've been down
Seen the world from the ground
But I hear the drumming
Now my veins are pumping
Scraped my knees, bruised my heart
It's where you end, not where you start
I see them running
'Cause they see me coming
You know that
All my life
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for this
All my life
I have been fighting, I have been fighting for this
Dream in my soul
And I won't let it go
You know that
All my life
They try to keep me down but I just get higher.
